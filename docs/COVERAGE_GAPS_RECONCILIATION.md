# Coverage gap reconciliation

Generated from `docs/COVERAGE_GAPS.md` by `scripts/generate_coverage_gap_reconciliation.py`.
A row is covered only when its actual Mode cell names a shipped check/tool; partial and out-of-scope are not readiness claims.

**100 rows:** covered_registry_or_tool=55, missing=31, out_of_scope=9, partial=5.

## Remaining priority order

Rows below are generated from unresolved map rows: stated value first, then the declared B/B+/A feasibility, then row number. The order is a planning aid, not a product-readiness claim.

1. Secrets leaked in HTML (14.6) — missing; A (HTML + regex)
2. Required fields per type (13.1) — partial; **mostly DONE** in the live `schema-check` (vocabulary + Google rich-result eligibility per type); audit ids still absent
3. Real Core Web Vitals (LCP/INP/CLS) (1.1) — partial; **partially DONE**: opt-in CrUX current record via `crux-report` and supplied `site-audit` evidence; no automatic crawl-registry check
4. YMYL detection (2.6) — partial; **Partial** — `YMYL_REVIEW_CANDIDATE`, never a classification
5. Render-blocking resources for bots (4.4) — missing; B (`ROBOTS_BLOCKS_RESOURCES` exists; extend)
6. Duplicate lang per target (7.9) — missing; B (graph) — still open (distinct from 7.10: this is one *target* with conflicting incoming langs, not one *source* repeating a lang)
7. Invalid rel=next/prev (12.1) — missing; B (Internal:All: rel_next/rel_prev)
8. Canonical chain on pagination (12.2) — missing; B (canonical x rel_next graph)
9. Pagination loop (12.3) — missing; B (graph)
10. Pagination orphan (12.5) — missing; B (Inlinks x rel_next)
