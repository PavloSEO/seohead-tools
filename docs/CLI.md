# CLI overview

Every public capability is one shared handler exposed twice: as a `seohead` CLI command and as
an MCP tool with the same name (`crawl-site` becomes `seo_crawl_site`). This page groups the
registered commands by job. Exact arguments, defaults, cost and failure modes live in the
generated [tool reference](TOOL_REFERENCE.md); network use and side effects per layer are
explained in [TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md); accepted inputs are in [INPUTS.md](INPUTS.md).

The **Effects** column comes from each tool's MCP annotations: `network` means the tool can send
requests, `writes` means it can create or change local files, and `paid` means it can spend
provider money. "Offline, read-only" tools neither send requests nor write files. Annotations
describe what a tool *may* do; most writes need an explicit flag such as `--apply` or `--out`,
and paid providers keep their sandbox or preview defaults where one exists.

Grouped CLI forms are aliases: `seohead scan list` is `scan-list` and `seohead project progress`
is `project-progress`.

## Entry points that are not single tools

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sf run` | Audit existing Screaming Frog CSV/XLSX exports offline (`--exports-dir`), or run a separately installed, licensed SF CLI first (`--crawl`). Writes `audit.json`/`audit.md`; `--tasks` adds the prioritized backlog. |
| `sf tasks` | Build `tasks.json`/`tasks.md` from an existing `audit.json` or scan artifact. |
| `sf doctor` | Diagnose SF CLI discovery and optional dependencies. |
| `sf save-config` | Copy the most recent SF crawl configuration into a reusable base config file. |
| `mcp` | Start the local stdio MCP server; `--profile` selects `full`, `audit`, `infra`, `quick-check` or `router` ([MCP profiles](MCP_PROFILES.md)). |
| `watch` | Optional Rich terminal observer for one project beside an AI chat ([terminal observer](TERMINAL.md)). Needs the `tui` extra. |
| `tui` | Interactive terminal shell over the same handlers ([TERMINAL.md](TERMINAL.md)). Needs the `tui` extra. |
| `scan`, `project`, `skill`, `scenario` | Grouped aliases for the `scan-*`, `project-*`, `skill-*` and `scenario-*` commands below. |

The `sf_*` MCP tools (`sf_audit_run`, `sf_audit_summary`, `sf_audit_issues`, `sf_audit_tasks`,
`sf_list_exports`) expose the Screaming Frog analyzer to agents.
