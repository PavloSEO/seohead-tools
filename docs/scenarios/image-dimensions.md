# Scenario 26 — Image geometry and weight: what the browser has to guess

## The question

> The page jumps around while it loads and the client noticed. Which images are doing it?

Layout shift has a mechanical cause: an `<img>` with no `width` and `height` occupies zero space
until its bytes arrive, and everything below it moves when they do. The heavier the file, the
longer that gap lasts — which is why dimensions and weight belong in one chain rather than two.

## Covers

- **Images** — Missing Size Attributes · Over 100 kb · Incorrectly Sized Images

## The chain

**1. Crawl, and read what the crawl declares it cannot answer.**

```bash
seohead crawl-site --url https://example.com --out-dir ./run --max-urls 200
```

```bash
seohead log-scan --run ./run
```

Both image checks are named as skipped in `run.checks_skipped`, because per-image attributes are
not in the record a native crawl builds:

```
{"id": "IMG_MISSING_DIMENSIONS", "reason": "missing export: images_missing_size"}
{"id": "IMG_OVER_KB",            "reason": "missing export: images_over_kb"}
```

`log-scan` is worth its twenty seconds here specifically: a recorded size that disagrees with
the file on disk is one of its eight rules, and it exists because a 739 KB WebP was once reported
as 1.27 MB. Every weight-based conclusion drawn from that run was wrong by a factor that differed
per file.

**2. Activate both checks from a Screaming Frog export.**

```bash
seohead sf run --exports-dir ./exports --out report --tasks
```

- `IMG_MISSING_DIMENSIONS` comes from the `Images:Missing Size Attributes` filter. It is a
  **notice**, not a warning — the page still works, it just moves — and its fix hint says the
  actual reason: declare intrinsic width and height to reserve layout space and reduce CLS.
- `IMG_OVER_KB` comes from the `Images:Over X KB` filter. Note the X: the catalogue's issue is
  named "Over 100 kb", and this toolkit's default threshold is **150 kb**, set in the config's
  `thresholds.img_max_kb`. Screaming Frog's own export filter has its own limit too. Quote the
  threshold that ran, not the one in the issue's name.

**3. Cross-check the sizes against the wire.** A crawl records `size_bytes` per URL measured
**before** the body is decoded, which is the number a browser waits for.

```bash
seohead parse --input '{"url": "https://example.com/page", "options": {"url_sources": true}}'
```

Every image carrier on the page comes back with the tag and attribute it was found on, including
CSS backgrounds — and a CSS background has no width and height attributes to be missing at all,
so it will never appear in the dimensions list however much it shifts the layout.

**4. Build the task.**

```bash
seohead sf tasks --json ./report/audit.json --out ./report
```

**5. Fix the weight half properly.** This chain names the heavy files. It does not make them
lighter. The [images scenario](images.md) downloads them, re-encodes them, and ends with an archive and
the per-file saving — on one live construction site, 82 files, 69.7 MB down to 27.4 MB.

## What comes out

A notice-level list of pages with undimensioned images, and a warning-level list of files over
the threshold, both keyed by page so a developer fixes one template rather than one image:

```
| check                  | severity | threshold | fix                                  |
| IMG_MISSING_DIMENSIONS | notice   | —         | declare intrinsic width and height    |
| IMG_OVER_KB            | warning  | 150 kb    | compress, and consider WebP or AVIF   |
```

## What it costs

Nothing beyond the crawl and the export you already have, plus one request per page inspected
with `parse`. No paid API. The re-encoding half, if you run it, is CPU-bound and local.

## What it cannot answer

- **How much layout shift actually happens.** CLS is measured in a browser under a real
  connection. A missing attribute is a cause; it is not a score. `render-check` gives lab
  timings from one machine, which are not field data either.
- **Whether an image is the wrong size for its box.** Comparing intrinsic pixels against the
  rendered layout box needs the rendered layout, and that is not collected. An oversized image
  scaled down in CSS is invisible to this chain.
- **Backgrounds and layout shift.** CSS backgrounds cannot carry dimensions, so they are absent
  from the finding by construction rather than by omission.
- **Whether the deploy keeps the saving.** A CMS that regenerates derivatives on upload can undo
  the whole thing.
- **Images written by JavaScript.** See the [rendering scenario](rendering.md).
