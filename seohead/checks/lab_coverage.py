"""Unused CSS and JavaScript from rendered-page coverage payloads.

Pure analysis, no browser and no network. It takes the lists returned by
Playwright's ``page.coverage.stop_js_coverage()`` and ``stop_css_coverage()``
and reports how much of each resource never executed (JS) or never applied
(CSS). Starting and stopping coverage on a rendered page is a separate step.

Units are character offsets into the source text as the browser reports them.
For ASCII-heavy minified sources this approximates bytes; the fields are named
``*_chars`` so the unit is never mistaken for bytes.

    analyze_css_coverage(entries, *, ratio_threshold, min_chars) -> dict
