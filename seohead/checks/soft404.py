"""Detect whether a site returns a genuine 404 for a nonexistent URL.

A broken link discovered by a crawler appears in crawl exports. A soft 404 is
different: the server returns **200 OK** for a nonexistent URL, often with a
templated "nothing found" page. Search engines can treat these responses as
low-value pages eligible for indexing.

Screaming Frog does not detect this through a normal crawl because it requests
known URLs rather than inventing nonexistent ones. The check therefore needs
active probes, like the reconnaissance modules.

The algorithm creates two deterministic nonexistent URLs from the origin's
SHA-256 hash at ordinary root paths. Requests use the shared HTTP layer with
redirects enabled because the final status matters, not the first hop. Strict
AND logic requires agreement: two 2xx/3xx responses confirm a soft 404
(warning), two 404/410 responses pass, and disagreement produces ``unknown``
without a verdict. A probe whose redirect was refused by our own network guard
(``recon.net.BlockedRedirectError``) is neither: the site tried to send the
probe somewhere we refuse to go, which is worth reporting by name rather than
folded into "the probes disagreed" (#175).
