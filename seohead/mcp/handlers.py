    never fetched — which was 74% of the entire report (issue #94). So the population is built
    here from what the crawl actually fetched:

    * fetched at all, with a real status — a URL nobody requested is evidence of nothing;
    * 2xx — a 404 or a redirect is not a page a sitemap should declare;
    * HTML by its own Content-Type — not an image, a PDF or a feed;
    * on the start URL's host — a sitemap may not declare someone else's domain;
    * indexable — a noindex page (meta robots or X-Robots-Tag) is deliberately excluded,
      and so is one this same crawl's own evidence marks ``robots_blocked`` (#316):
      ``build_evidence()``'s ``_indexability()`` already projects a robots-blocked URL as
      non-indexable, and a report-only robots policy still fetches and links the page, so
      leaving it comparable here let one page be simultaneously non-indexable (BLOCKED_BY_ROBOTS)
      and reported as an indexable page the sitemap forgot (URL_NOT_IN_SITEMAP) -- two
      first-class projections of the same crawl contradicting each other.

    The 2xx+HTML re-check below looks like the gap ``AuditContext.html_pages`` had before
    issue #133 (it isn't calling that method), but ``result.pages`` here are
    ``seohead.crawl.collect.PageRecord`` from a native crawl, not ``sf.core.models.Page`` — a
    different type with no ``AuditContext`` in scope at this point, and this population also
    needs the host and indexable filters ``html_pages`` never applied. Fixing #133 narrowed
    ``html_pages`` to match this function's already-correct logic; it did not make this
    re-check redundant, since there is no shared call to route through.

    The interface layer is where collector and analyzer are allowed to meet:
    ``seohead.crawl`` gathers evidence and never imports the analyzer,
    ``seohead.sf`` judges it and never imports the collector, and this function
    hands the projection from one to the other.

    ``min_delay`` defaults to half a second because the target is somebody's
    production site: polite by accident beats fast by accident.

    ``sitemap`` (or ``sitemaps.auto_discover`` in ``config``) seeds the crawl
    from a sitemap's declared URLs, in addition to following links from
    ``url``, and reconciles the two sources — see
    ``seohead.crawl.reconcile.reconcile_sitemap``. The same URL also feeds
    ``seohead.sf.core.sitemap_coverage.run_sitemap``, which independently
    re-fetches it to check the sitemap protocol's own limits and whether
    robots.txt declares it; with none given, those checks skip by name
    rather than guess at a default sitemap location.

    ``resume`` names an interrupted SQLite scan artifact to continue instead of
    describing a new crawl. It is the whole input: the start URL and every
    crawler setting are read back from the artifact, because they are what the
    stored frontier was built under. Passing any other crawl-shaping argument
    alongside it is therefore an error rather than an override -- see
    ``seohead.mcp.scan_handlers.resume_scan`` for the refusals decided
    before the first request.
    ``progress`` is a live-progress callback taking ``(fetched, queued)``. It
    is an interface-layer concern rather than a crawler setting -- only a
    caller with a terminal has anywhere to put a progress line -- so it is a
    plain callable here and has no place in ``config`` or the run manifest.
    List mode is not covered: its workload is the list, known in full before
    the first request, and the honest report of a known total is a different
    line than this one (see ``seohead.crawl.progress``).
