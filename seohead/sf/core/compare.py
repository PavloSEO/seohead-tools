"""Diff two audits: what changed, not just what each one found separately.

The most repeated billable question in audit work is "did the developer
actually ship the fix", and a naive diff cannot answer it. A page that stopped
matching a finding because it was fixed, and a page that stopped matching
because it was deleted from the crawl entirely, look identical if you only
compare two sets of findings — and they mean opposite things.

So every finding lands in exactly one of four disjoint sets, keyed by the
finding's own fingerprint plus the URL it was found on:

    entered      the URL existed in both crawls; it did not match before, matches now
    left         the URL existed in both crawls; it matched before, does not match now
    appeared     the URL is new to this crawl, and matches now
    disappeared  the URL is gone from this crawl, and matched before

"left" is progress. "disappeared" is not progress — the URL that was broken is
simply no longer part of what was measured, which is a different fact and must
not be reported as a fix.

An audit-wide finding (no ``target_url`` — e.g. TITLE_TEMPLATED, which
describes the crawl as a whole) has no page to appear or disappear, so it can
only ever land in "entered" or "left": the condition it describes now holds,
or it no longer does.

    silently treated as empty, because an empty crawl and an unreadable one
    must not look the same in the result. A known difference between the two
    effective crawl configurations is also refused unless the caller passes
    ``force=True``: a changed robots policy or URL budget is not evidence that
    the site itself changed. Warnings about a partial crawl remain result data;
    they do not erase the historical observations or recategorize them.
