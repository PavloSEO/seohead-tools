"""Missing security headers on HTML pages, read from a stored crawl's own response evidence (#1013).

Sibling to ``link_findings.py``: the predicate is pure over header pairs, and the only database
access is one read-only query over ``pages`` and ``responses``. A header is judged on the
final response of an HTML page that answered 2xx. Other media types are not judged, because a
missing Content-Security-Policy on a PDF or an image is not a defect of the page that links it.

Presence is what is checked, matching how Screaming Frog words these issues ("Missing ... Header").
Header values are not validated. X-Frame-Options is satisfied by a CSP ``frame-ancestors``
directive, the same rule ``seohead.recon.security`` applies to a live response.
