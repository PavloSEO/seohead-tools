"""Track paid-provider usage: what was charged, for which operation, and when.

A local ledger is necessary even when a provider exposes account history. Informal estimates can
drift from actual usage, and a parsing failure must not hide a charge. Two rules follow:

1. **Record a charge as soon as the provider returns its cost**, before parsing the result. A
   parser failure must not turn a paid response into an untraceable expense.
2. **Record the task identifier as well.** Arsenkin results can be fetched again by ``task_id``
   without paying twice. The ledger is therefore also an index of already-paid tasks.

The format is JSONL, one line per call. Appending a line is atomic, so an interrupted process does
not corrupt prior entries. The default path is ``~/.config/seohead/spend.jsonl`` and can be
overridden with ``SEOHEAD_SPEND_LOG``.
