# Personal macOS installer

Build only, never run the installer as part of validation:

```bash
python packaging/macos/build.py --core-source /path/to/seohead-tools --python /path/to/build-venv/bin/python
pkgutil --payload-files dist/SEOHEAD-Desktop.pkg
```

PyInstaller is used because the existing, verified `scripts/build_macos.sh` already
co-ships a frozen core, native PyQt5 runtime, control agent, approved app icon and
source/runtime SHA-256 manifest. Reusing it keeps one package identity and smoke
contract. Source checkouts must be clean, with the selected core/desktop on the
build interpreter's import path. The build extra pins PyInstaller; core extras
must be installed in that environment. Generated files stay in ignored `dist/`.
No paid certificate, Developer ID signature or notarization is used. PyInstaller
and the existing bundler apply local ad-hoc signatures required by macOS runtime.

The pkg payload places the app in `/Applications/SEOHEAD Desktop.app` and its
same-version CLI wrapper in `/usr/local/bin/seohead`. The postinstall only checks
the installed payload and wrapper mode, respects the destination volume, and
starts no processes. It writes no agent configuration. Inspect the scripts before
manual installation. `SEOHEAD_APP_PATH` lets wrapper smoke tests point at the app
in the build directory; it is unnecessary after installation.

Pavel installs the package manually, with macOS administrator authorization:

```bash
sudo installer -pkg dist/SEOHEAD-Desktop.pkg -target /
```

For a DMG, add `--dmg`. The first-run screen offers **Install command line tool**:
it asks macOS for administrator authorization only after an explicit click.
Cancelling authorization makes no change. The app checks its verified co-shipped
core before offering this action. A regular source launch never installs a wrapper.

Manual uninstall: `sudo sh packaging/macos/uninstall.sh --yes`. It refuses a
foreign wrapper or unrecognized app, removes only this wrapper, archives the app
alongside its original location, and forgets this pkg receipt. Projects, settings,
agent entries and backups stay in place. `--yes DESTINATION_VOLUME` supports
isolated script validation. No system install/uninstall is performed by tests.
