"""Base of design-v2 screens.

A screen renders from state the main window already holds (project result, scan rows, observer runs, tasks, inbox)
and asks the window for actions; it never calls the core, SQL or the network itself. ``refresh`` must be cheap and
bounded: tables are models with delegates, never a widget per cell.
