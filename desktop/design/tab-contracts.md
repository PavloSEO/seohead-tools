# Native tab and panel contracts

This change prepares reusable Qt Widgets and a runnable offline component gallery.
It does not connect all panels to the core, implement an analyzer, or claim parity
with every Screaming Frog release. The working application adapter remains owned
by `app.py` / `mcp_gateway.py`; the new widgets accept projections and emit intents.

## Verified input and scope

- Source checkout: `seohead-desktop`, baseline `3f939d447c044e8cbaabce71e20e4e38eabdd721`.
- Reference inspected on 2026-10-07: the already-open **Screaming Frog SEO Spider
  19.8 (Licensed)** window. Its scan was complete and idle. The inspected crawl
  belonged to the user's own site. No new scan, export, provider request, or
  configuration change was made; navigation returned to Internal / URL Details /
  Issues. Customer rows, page source, and scan counts are not copied into the code.
- The configured reference exposed **21 main tabs, 12 lower inspector tabs, and
  6 right tabs**. Main Configure Tabs had an empty Hidden list and 21 Visible
  entries. This is the observed configuration, not a claim about conditional tabs
  or another SF version.
- Columns were read per main/detail/right tab. Filter families were inspected in
  the Internal selector and the expanded Overview tree. **241 main filter labels**
  are catalogued. Their thresholds describe the inspected reference; they are not
  analyzer settings or default SEOHEAD policy.
- Configure Tabs has Hidden / Visible lists, per-list search, movement and reorder
  controls. The Qt implementation retains this workflow and adds an explicit
  cancel path, a guard against hiding every tab, and a direct overflow menu.

## Design skeleton

The existing SEOHEAD light theme, Roboto, rounded controls, blue active indicator,
and packaged Material Symbols are reused. A native Qt refresh icon fills the one
missing refresh asset. `component_stylesheet(tokens)` consumes the existing
canonical token dictionary; it introduces no second color palette. Final visual
design remains a separate stage.

The main workspace is two nested `QSplitter`s: main table above the URL inspector,
with an independent right deck. Decks are native `QTabBar` plus a lazy stacked
panel. A hidden SERP form cannot force the visible table's minimum height. At a
narrow width, each table toolbar puts search on its own row. Wide tables scroll
horizontally, columns can be moved/resized/hidden, and long cell values have a
bounded tooltip. The user can hide and restore the two auxiliary panes.

Every table uses `QAbstractTableModel` / `QSortFilterProxyModel` / `QTableView`.
There are no row widgets, web views, databases, backend imports, or hidden reads.
The model consumes at most 101 iterator entries to validate the **100-row limit**;
an oversized page raises without replacing existing rows. This establishes a
presentation bound, not million-row or large-crawl acceptance.

The search field filters the currently loaded page and says so. Sorting is also
local to that page. Global filtering/paging is an explicit `query` intent. A
catalogued filter stays disabled unless the adapter lists its stable ID in
`available_filters`; duplicate/global/graph findings are never recomputed from
the visible 100 rows.

States are `ready`, `loading`, `unavailable`, and `error`, plus a measured empty
result represented by `ready` and zero rows. `total=None` means unknown. An absent
field renders as **Не измерено**, while `0`, `False`, and an empty string remain
distinct. Switching source/page or moving to a tab without a selected URL clears
stale inspector evidence. Sensitive cookie/header/config values are redacted at
the presentation boundary as an additional defense.

## Capability to UI matrix

The full column/filter definitions and stable IDs are in
`src/seohead_desktop/ui/tabcatalogue.py`; they are the single catalogue source.
All rows below have a runnable widget. “Required projection” describes the input
the adapter must actually supply before the widget can claim measured data.

| Pane / IDs | Widget and behavior | Required projection / boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Main: `internal` | URL table, MIME selector, paging, selection | Normalized retained `scan-inspect --table pages` page: `url`, `status`, `type`, `indexability`, `title`, `issues`; missing extra columns stay unknown |
| Main: `external` | Address / content type / response / depth / inlinks | Retained external link/resource projection; never copy internal rows as external evidence |
| Main: `security` | Response/indexability/directives; security filter catalogue | Retained security findings plus allowed response headers |
| Main: `response_codes` | HTTP / response time / redirect table; internal/external filter families | Retained response and redirect evidence; JavaScript/robots filters require their own coverage |
| Main: `url` | Address / encoding / length / hash / canonical | Core URL findings; fragments and internal search require supported evidence |
| Main: `page_titles`, `meta_description`, `meta_keywords` | Occurrence/value/length tables; duplicate/threshold/head-position filters | Retained extracted values and analyzer findings; pixel widths never estimated by Qt |
| Main: `h1`, `h2` | Heading occurrence/value/length tables | Retained heading evidence and analyzer findings |
| Main: `content` | Word/sentence/readability/duplicate/language table | Retained complete analysis; a missing language run is unavailable |
| Main: `images` | MIME/size/inlinks/dimensions table | Retained image occurrence/resource evidence, including missing-vs-empty alt |
| Main: `canonicals`, `pagination`, `directives`, `hreflang` | Reference/directive tables and all observed filter families | Core graph/directive findings and provenance; repeated values are retained lists, not fabricated numbered fields |
| Main: `links` | Inlink/outlink/depth/score table | Retained link graph; counts cannot be inferred from a page of links |
| Main: `amp` | AMP response/content/canonical table | Retained AMP evidence; validation has no implicit network fallback |
| Main: `structured_data` | Types/errors/warnings table | Retained extraction and validation; eligibility for rich results is not inferred |
| Main: `sitemaps` | Sitemap URL/response/indexability table | Retained sitemap reconciliation and completeness |
| Main: `validation` | HTML structural finding table | Retained HTML validation output |
| Lower: `url_details` | Name/value table | Only fields from the actual selected record; absent fields remain unknown |
| Lower: `inlinks`, `outlinks`, `resources` | From/to/anchor/rel/follow/path/origin table | Direction-aware retained link/resource query |
| Lower: `image_details` | Occurrence / alt / dimensions / savings table | Retained image measurements; no invented thumbnails or savings |
| Lower: `serp_snippet` | Editable local title/description preview, reset | Retained fields; edits affect only the preview, and actual search appearance is explicitly unmeasured |
| Lower: `view_source` | Read-only plain text with find and 65,536-character cap | Retained source supplied by adapter; no HTML or JavaScript execution |
| Lower: `http_headers`, `cookies` | Metadata tables | Retained redacted request/response headers and cookie metadata |
| Lower: `duplicate_details` | URL / match / similarity / indexability table | Retained duplicate analysis |
| Lower: `structured_data_details` | Property/value/validation/severity/details | Retained schema validation |
| Lower: `spelling_grammar_details` | Text/type/detail/suggestions/section/address | Retained language-check evidence |
| Right: `overview` | Category / URL count / percentage table | Core aggregates and scope, never a percentage calculated from the loaded page |
| Right: `issues` | Finding/type/priority/URL/% table | Retained findings; issue selection emits a semantic intent |
| Right: `site_structure` | Path / URLs / indexable / non-indexable table | Bounded core structure projection; hierarchy/chart rendering is a later enhancement |
| Right: `response_times` | Timing-bucket/count/% table | Core histogram; chart rendering is a later enhancement |
| Right: `api` | Provider/state/reason/observed-at table | Existing readiness projection; opening the tab makes no provider request |
| Right: `spelling_grammar` | Top-error/count/coverage/language/sample table | Bounded retained error projection |
| Project: `work`, `tasks` | State/dependency/reason tables, task selection | `project-progress`, `project-checklist-page`, `project-task-detail` |
| Project: `scans` | Source/lifecycle/finished/partial table, scan selection | Trusted `project-scans` items; preserve UUID and trusted path in selection payload |
| Project: `reanalyze` | Retained-scan selection table | Selection/preview only; execution belongs to the core adapter and its explicit action |
| Project: `compare` | Two retained-scan choosers, preview intent, result table | Require two distinct IDs; core must check scope/config/provenance before comparison |
| Project: `scenarios`, `skills` | Registry metadata tables and selection intents | Actual existing core registry, no fabricated installed/readiness status |
| Project: `competitors` | Domain/source/date/scope/state table | Retained authorized competitor records; no discovery or paid call |
| Project: `inbox` | Message table plus explicit note/question form | `project-inbox-list/unread`; disabled submission until adapter enables it; text remains until success acknowledgment |
| Project: `remediation` | Finding/state/owner/recheck/evidence table | Existing finding/work-item lifecycle; “fixed” needs actual recheck evidence |
| Project: `schema` | URL/types/validation/errors/warnings/evidence table | Retained schema results, no CMS publication |
| Project: `providers` | Readiness/reason/observed/scope table | Existing source readiness; secrets stay hidden |
| Project: `logs` | Bounded redacted event table | Existing core event page |
| Project: `config` | Effective parameter/value/origin/state/reason table | Validated config projection; no implicit writes or credential values |
| Project: `reports` | Artifact/format/state/date/coverage/omissions table | Existing validated artifacts and complete machine-readable evidence |

## Integration recipe

```python
from seohead_desktop.ui.panels import AuditWorkspace, ProjectPanels, component_stylesheet

# Reuse the existing load_theme result once; this does not mutate token files.
app.setStyleSheet(app.styleSheet() + component_stylesheet(tokens))
audit = AuditWorkspace(parent)
projects = ProjectPanels(parent)

audit.set_page(
    "internal", normalized_page_rows,
    total=known_total_or_none, offset=page_offset, has_more=has_more,
    source="Retained native scan · <actual scan identity>",
    available_filters=("all",),
)
projects.set_page("tasks", checklist_items, total=known_total_or_none, source="Project checklist")
projects.set_page("scans", trusted_scan_items, total=known_total_or_none, source="Project retained scans")

audit.intent_requested.connect(controller.handle_audit_intent)
projects.select_task.connect(controller.select_task)
projects.select_scan.connect(controller.select_scan)
projects.refresh.connect(controller.refresh)
projects.submit_note.connect(controller.submit_note)
# Connect projects.intent_requested for query/open_panel/preview_compare and other
# intents only. Do not dispatch the same typed intent twice through both routes.
```

`set_page` takes an iterable of mapping rows plus keyword-only `total`, `offset`,
`has_more`, `source`, `state`, `reason`, and `available_filters`. A page has at most
100 rows. Native URLs use the current adapter's normalized `type` / `status`
keys. Extra keys, including the trusted retained item/path, are preserved in the
selected row but do not create columns automatically.

Generic intents are `(name, payload)`:

| Name | Payload |
|---|---|
| `open_panel`, `refresh` | `{tab_id}` |
| `query` | `{tab_id, offset, limit: 100, filter_id}` |
| `select_url`, `select_issue`, `select_record`, `select_task`, `select_scan`, `select_skill`, `select_scenario`, `select_note`, `select_report` | `{tab_id, row}` |
| `submit_note` | `{text, kind}`; emitted only by an enabled form click |
| `preview_compare` | `{before, after}`; original trusted scan items |

Typed project signals are `refresh()`, `select_task(str)`, `select_scan(dict)`, and
`submit_note(str, str)`. `panel("inbox").set_submission_enabled(True)` is explicit.
Call `submission_succeeded()` only after the core confirms storage. Do not call it
merely because the signal was emitted. `panel("compare").set_scans(items)` fills
the two bounded choosers. A changed project/source calls `audit.clear()` and
`projects.clear()` before asynchronous replacement; normal generation guards stay
in the existing adapter.

`deck.visible_ids` is a serializable tuple. `set_visible_tabs(ids)` validates it,
`select_tab(id)` reveals a hidden tab if needed, and the menu restores all defaults.
The components do not persist user settings; the existing application owns that.
Both decks expose their `QTabBar` for normal keyboard navigation, and tables use
native row selection and Copy. `audit.right` and `audit.detail` may be hidden by
the existing View menu; `audit.restore_panels()` restores their visibility/sizes.

No proposed `scan-url-detail` or other unpublished core endpoint is required by
these widgets. A richer projection can be connected only after its core contract
exists and is verified.

## Run and acceptance

From this checkout, using an environment that already contains PyQt5:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m seohead_desktop.ui.gallery
PYTHONPATH=src QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
PYTHONPATH=src QT_QPA_PLATFORM=cocoa python -m seohead_desktop.ui.gallery --capture-dir /absolute/output/directory
```

The gallery is visibly synthetic (`example.test`) and contains no gateway calls.
It exercises local filtering, URL selection, source/preview states, task/scan
selection, and note/compare events without performing the corresponding backend
operation. Every one of the 54 panel widgets is exercised in measured-empty and
unavailable states by the component suite. Native Cocoa captures are separate
from offscreen tests. Live macOS accessibility verification covers URL search,
tab switching, and stale-evidence clearing; menu click behavior is additionally
verified with actual Qt mouse events. Windows/Linux runtime, real adapter
integration, and large-crawl performance remain separate acceptance gates.

Images and the measured acceptance manifest are kept under the workspace outputs
directory; synthetic acceptance metadata is in `design/component-acceptance.json`.
