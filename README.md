SEOHEAD turns a project goal into repeatable technical-SEO work: crawl or import evidence, keep it
in a retained SQLite scan, analyse it offline, compare releases, hand prioritized tasks to
developers, recheck their fixes and build reports. Everything runs on your machine through one
Python core, with a native desktop app, a CLI and a local MCP server on top. There is no hosted
account and no web dashboard.

## Three ways to use it

| Interface | For | Start with |
|---|---|---|
| **Desktop** — SEOHEAD Desktop for macOS, Windows and Linux | Crawling, issues, URL inspector, link graph, toolbox and project work in a native window | `seohead-desktop --project ./shop` |
| **CLI** — `seohead` | Scripts, CI and terminal work | `seohead crawl-site --url https://example.com --max-urls 500 --scan-out ./scans/audit.sqlite` |
| **MCP** — local stdio server | Claude and other agent clients | `claude mcp add seohead -- /absolute/path/to/seohead-tools/.venv/bin/seohead mcp` |

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/screenshots/desktop-quick-scan.png" alt="SEOHEAD Desktop: a running crawl with the internal URL table and the scan overview panel" width="100%"></p>

All three call the same shared handlers (`crawl-site` in the CLI is `seo_crawl_site` over MCP) and
work on the same local projects and retained scans.

## Install

### SEOHEAD Desktop

The app lives in `desktop/` and installs together with the core (Python 3.10 or newer):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PavloSEO/seohead-tools.git
cd seohead-tools
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[all]" -e desktop
seohead-desktop --project /path/to/existing/project
```

Packaging (PyInstaller bundles with the core and the `seohead` CLI) and the source install are
described in `desktop/docs/`.

### Core toolkit (CLI and MCP)

Python 3.10 or newer. Clone the repository and install it into a virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PavloSEO/seohead-tools.git
cd seohead-tools
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[all]"

# Confirm the installed interface.
seohead --help
```

With [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), `uv sync --all-extras` creates the same environment from
the committed `uv.lock`, and `uv run seohead --help` runs it. On Windows PowerShell, activate the
virtual environment with `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`.

The repository is named `seohead-tools`; the Python distribution is `seohead-seotools` and the
installed command and import package are `seohead`.

`all` installs every optional dependency; smaller extras (`mcp`, `render`, `reports`, `pdf`, `cluster`,
`gsc`, `sitemap`, `tui`, `remote`) are listed in [SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md).

Provider credentials and browser binaries are separate and never required for the core crawl.
[Setup from zero](docs/SETUP.md) covers versions, environment variables, Docker
([CONTAINERS.md](docs/CONTAINERS.md)) and Linux servers without a display ([LINUX_VPS.md](docs/LINUX_VPS.md)).

## Quick start

### 1. Crawl a site, audit it, build a report

```bash
# Crawl locally. The URL cap is an explicit budget, not a claim about site size.
seohead crawl-site \
  --url https://example.com \
  --max-urls 500 \
  --scan-out ./scans/audit.sqlite

# Format the retained audit as a working spreadsheet or a client document.
seohead report-build --audit ./scans/audit.sqlite --format xlsx --out audit.xlsx
seohead report-build --audit ./scans/audit.sqlite --format docx --out audit.docx
```

`crawl-site` is the primary collector: free, local, polite by default (about two requests per
second per host), resumable ([RECOVERY.md](docs/RECOVERY.md)) and configurable through
`--config`/`--set` (see `seohead crawl-site --config-help` and
the [configuration inventory](docs/HEADLESS_CAPABILITIES.md)). It sends only bounded, read-only
requests to the site you name. `report-build` formats existing evidence as XLSX, DOCX, CSV,
Markdown, JSON or a bounded PDF overview ([PDF_OVERVIEW.md](docs/PDF_OVERVIEW.md)); it never
invents findings.

### 2. Analyse existing Screaming Frog exports

```bash
# Offline: no SF installation, licence or request to the site is needed.
seohead sf run --exports-dir docs/examples/exports --out ./report --tasks
```

You get `audit.json`, `audit.md` and a prioritized `tasks.md`/`tasks.json` backlog with
reproduction steps, DOM positions and fixes. A separately installed, licensed SF CLI can also be
driven directly with `sf run --crawl`. Other crawlers' CSV exports are not drop-in compatible; they
are read through a versioned manifest ([THIRD_PARTY_CRAWL_IMPORT.md](docs/THIRD_PARTY_CRAWL_IMPORT.md)).

### 3. Run it as a project with an agent

```bash
# These calls only create or inspect local project state; they do not crawl.
seohead project new --directory ./shop --target https://example.com/
seohead project checklist-init --directory ./shop
seohead project progress --directory ./shop
```

Register the MCP server (below), then ask the agent for the outcome you need, for example:

> Audit this site for the agreed scope. Give the developers an Excel workbook of tasks, the
> underlying exports and evidence links, proposed fixes, and acceptance/recheck criteria.

The agent starts from the [control](.claude/skills/control/SKILL.md) skill, records scope and
crawl policy in the project, reuses retained evidence and follows the
[developer handoff](docs/scenarios/deliverable.md) scenario. See
[Projects and agent handoff](#projects-and-agent-handoff).

## Desktop app

SEOHEAD Desktop is a native PyQt5 application for macOS, Windows and Linux. It is a presentation
layer over the same core: it opens the same local projects and retained scans as the CLI and MCP
server, so a crawl started in the terminal or by an agent shows up in the window and the other
way round.

- **Crawler** — enter a URL and press Start, no project needed; save the result as a project later.
- **Project work** — goal, tasks, inbox and run history in a *With agent* display, or the same
  projects, scans and reports without AI features in a *Simple* display.
- **URLs, issues, link graph, compare** — browse retained evidence, rechecks and before/after scans.
- **Tools** — a built-in toolbox: every core tool with a ready-made form, plus a one-click image
  pipeline — compress, convert to WebP/AVIF, generate 301 redirects and hand the task to your
  developer or agent.
- **Methods and reports** — the core's method skills and report builders behind ready-made screens.
- **MCP switch** — one shared state with the CLI (`seohead mcp status`); the app registers the
  server in Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex or Cursor only after a permission dialog that lists
  the files and lines it will change, with backups.
- **Installers** — macOS `.pkg`, Windows setup and Linux tarball put the app and the `seohead`
  command on the machine together. Light, dark and high-contrast themes; English and Russian.

## MCP server for Claude and other agents

**Claude Code** — register the installed CLI (use the absolute path to your virtual environment):

```bash
claude mcp add seohead -- /absolute/path/to/seohead-tools/.venv/bin/seohead mcp
```

Inside this repository the committed [`.mcp.json`](.mcp.json) already registers `seohead` for
Claude Code when the virtual environment is active.

**Claude Desktop and other stdio clients** — add the server to the client's MCP configuration
(`claude_desktop_config.json` for Claude Desktop):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "seohead": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/seohead-tools/.venv/bin/seohead",
      "args": ["mcp", "--profile", "full"]
    }
  }
}
```

`--profile full` exposes every tool; `audit`, `infra`, `quick-check` and `router` expose smaller
schema sets for focused sessions. `seohead mcp status` shows the shared on/off state that the
desktop app uses too. Progress notifications are sent only when the client supplies
a progress token. See [MCP profiles and progress](docs/MCP_PROFILES.md).

An agent discovers routes with `seo_tool_catalog`, loads a method with `seo_skill_show` and an
end-to-end chain with `seo_scenario_show`. A catalogue entry describes a capability; it does not
execute it. The CLI shows the same catalogue:

```bash
seohead tool-catalog --query redirect --limit 5
```

## Projects and agent handoff

A project directory keeps the site, agreed scope, crawl policy, checklist coverage, retained scans,
saved finding views and run history, so a new agent continues from the saved project instead of
chat history: define the goal and scope, collect once and analyse again, compare, create developer
tasks, track repairs and report.

`seohead watch --project DIRECTORY` opens an optional terminal observer beside the chat
([TERMINAL.md](docs/TERMINAL.md)). The inbox stores the specialist's notes and proposed goals;
workflow runs checkpoint each registered step with hashed evidence so another agent can resume
exactly where the first stopped ([WORKFLOWS.md](docs/WORKFLOWS.md)). Task completion and site
health stay separate: a prepared project or a completed task is not proof that a site error was
fixed. Details: [Projects](docs/PROJECTS.md), [project-control scenario](docs/scenarios/project-control.md),
[remediation ledger](docs/LEDGER.md).

## What is measured and what is not

Every audit separates four outcomes:

- **Finding:** the available evidence supports a specific problem.
- **Ran without findings:** the check was evaluated and found nothing.
- **Skipped:** required evidence was unavailable or incomplete; the report names the check and reason.
- **Failed or unavailable tool:** the boundary failure is recorded instead of being treated as a pass.

Partial crawls withhold conclusions that need complete evidence, such as link-graph claims, and
health scores are withheld or marked not comparable when coverage is low. Native crawls and
Screaming Frog are different collectors and may discover different URL populations; compare them
only with compatible scope, configuration and provenance.

Known limits: native crawl and browser results are lab evidence, not field Core Web Vitals
(`crux-report` is credential-gated); `site-audit` is a bounded sitemap pass, not a link-graph
crawl; `backlinks-check` verifies donor pages you supply rather than a web-scale index; full
parity with commercial crawlers on very large or JavaScript-heavy sites is a direction, not a
verified claim ([COMPARISON.md](docs/COMPARISON.md),
[MILLION_CRAWL_ACCEPTANCE.md](docs/MILLION_CRAWL_ACCEPTANCE.md)).

Safety boundaries: network tools block private targets unless explicitly allowed; file mutation,
service-path probes, bot DNS verification, provider production mode and paid calls require
explicit inputs. DataForSEO defaults to sandbox, and paid calls are journalled for `spend-report`.
Image optimization writes to a separate directory unless in-place mode is requested, which keeps
backups. Secrets and client crawl data never belong in this repository or a client report.
See [the audit guideline](docs/GUIDELINE.md) and [GOTCHAS.md](docs/GOTCHAS.md).

pytest -q
seohead sf run --exports-dir docs/examples/exports --out /tmp/seohead-report --tasks
python -m build
```

Public commands, counts and generated references are checked in CI: a command shown in the docs
must still run, and generated pages must match the registries. Keep public prose in English, use
synthetic examples and reserved domains only, and add a focused offline test whenever behaviour
changes. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md),
[architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [testing](docs/TESTING.md).

## Licence and provenance

The core toolkit and documentation are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE). SEOHEAD Desktop
in `desktop/` is GPL-3.0-or-later, as required by PyQt5 (see `desktop/LICENSE`). The
bundled Schema.org vocabulary keeps its original CC BY-SA terms. See
